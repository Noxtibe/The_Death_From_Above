# The_Death_From_Above
 
Unreal 5 personnal project on re-doing some mecanics from Dishonored like :
- The blink
- A tornado spell
- Dark vision

And i've worked on doing a behavior tree with AI capable of :

- Patrol between specific points (loop, wait & random)
- Can detect the player with the sound, touch & view
- Can be take down by the player when sneaky
